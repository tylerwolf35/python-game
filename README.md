# Python Game

This is really just a small repository I am working on because I was bored. This attempts to teach the player on the basics of Python
before going into a guess the randomly generated number game. Currently this is very limited but I hope to have much more.

## What is currently here:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Variables

## What I plan to add:
* Conditional Statements
* Looping
* Modules
